# custom-debugger-patches
A collection of patches to the st3 version of the Debugger plugin for Sublime.

Credit for nearly all content in the patches/ directory goes to the developers of the [Debugger plugin](https://github.com/daveleroy/sublime_debugger).

The contents of those files were minimally modified to fit our needs.
